# One_Page_Shopping_Cart
This is a single page responsive Ecommerce site, this displays products fetched from a public API. There is an "Add To Cart" functionality that will add any product to the cart and inside the cart one can add or remove any item, one can directly clear the cart, the cart is hidden at first, the cart can be toggled with the cart icon and the close button in the cart sidebar. The individual price and total price is calculated in cart screen. I have used the REACT framework to do the project and axios dependencies to GET the data. Usestate and Useeffect are used to set some functions and variables. 

The source code is in the master branch. The public url for this site is :- https://sleepy-joliot-ec93b8.netlify.app/
